# transfer-learning
CIFAR-10 classification project using transfer learning approach

In this github project you can find ipython notebook called transfer_learning.ipynb which intends to guide you through my problem solving process. There are also two python files where I stored most of the helping functions to keep the notebook clean. I did not add folder with pickled dataset, since it could be downloaded from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
